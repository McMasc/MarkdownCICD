# Markdown CI/CD Pipeline

This project is a CI/CD pipeline designed to process markdown files. The logic for processing the markdown files is defined in a specific markdown file, where each header represents a separate job written as a C# script. Each job has its own cron schedule for execution.

## Overview

The Markdown CI/CD pipeline reads a markdown file where each header corresponds to a job. These jobs are written in C# script format and define specific tasks to be executed based on the schedule provided. The cron expression under each header defines when the job should be executed. 

This pipeline can be integrated into any CI/CD tool to automate workflows like generating reports, scheduling daily tasks, or processing documents, using the markdown structure as the logic driver.

## Features

- **C# Script Execution:** Each job is defined as a C# script under markdown headers.
- **Cron Scheduling:** Jobs can be scheduled using cron expressions.
- **Markdown-based Logic:** The pipeline is driven by a markdown file that serves as both documentation and configuration.
- **Automated Job Execution:** Jobs are automatically triggered and executed based on their cron schedules.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markdown-cicd.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Usage

1. Define jobs in a markdown file (`jobs.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Daily Note Header
   Cron: * * * * *
   
   ```csharp
   // C# Script
   Console.WriteLine("Executing Daily Note Job...");
   // Add your logic here
   ```

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. The pipeline will automatically parse the markdown file, schedule jobs, and execute them based on the defined cron expressions.

## Jobs Structure

Each job in the markdown file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Job Title

Cron: <cron expression>

```csharp
// C# Script
// Add your job logic here
```

- **Job Title:** The header that identifies the job.
- **Cron Expression:** Defines the execution schedule for the job.
- **C# Script:** The logic to be executed when the job runs.

### Example:

```markdown
# Daily Note Generator

Cron: 0 0 * * *

```csharp
// This script generates daily notes
Console.WriteLine("Generating daily notes...");
```
